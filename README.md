# Pyknotic
General Pyknosis

These are notes for a series of talks at MSRI about the \emph{pyknotic formalism}, which offers a way to coordinate `continuous' and `derived' structures.
This formalism is only partially developed, but itâ€™s already clear that there is a lot to explore, and lots of interesting possible applications.
Many different points of view on pyknotic objects will be necessary to develop these applications.

The MSRI lectures were given to rooms full of people with a good deal of experience in category theory.
As a result, I have opted to focus on aspects of the story that are not formal, and we have left many of the more categorical consequences of the results here unproved but in the safe hands of experts.
