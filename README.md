General Pyknosis

The pyknotic formalism offers a way to coordinate ‘topological’ and ‘derived’ structures. This formalism is only partially developed, but it’s already clear that there is a lot to explore, and a lot of interesting possible applications. Many different points of view on pyknotic objects will be necessary to develop these applications.

What I’m doing now is starting a text I’m calling ‘General Pyknosis’. The idea will be to go carefully through the foundations of the pyknotic formalism, through the classes of examples I reckon are most important, and into some of the theorems I know how to prove. I can’t promise it’ll be tremendously exciting, at least at first, but it’ll be a toolkit.
