These are notes for a series of talks at MSRI about the \emph{pyknotic formalism}.

The pyknotic formalism offers a way to coordinate `topological' and `derived' structures.
This formalism is only partially developed, but itâ€™s already clear that there is a lot to explore, and a lot of interesting possible applications.
Many different points of view on pyknotic objects will be necessary to develop these applications.
